This was a project that was done in Summer 2022. It is a simple planner app. 

### What it does
It opens into a homepage that has a calendar widget. By clicking the current or a future date, you
travel to a new page where you can add tasks associated with that date. These tasks get stored in
a sqlite database, therefore the tasks get loaded once you enter the app again after exiting.
